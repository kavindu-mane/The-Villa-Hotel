                                You can also snorkel off the beach at Unawatuna. The best snorkeling is about 1 km offshore, hence you will need to hire the Submarine dive school’s glass-bottom boat.Snorkeling equipment could also be hired from them as well as from a couple of cheaper shacks nearby on the beach.<br />
                                Please be sure to check out all snorkeling equipment you hope to hire as there are plenty of dud masks and snorkels in circulation.

                                Nowhere else in the world do whales and dolphins venture so close to the coast and in such numbers as they do off Mirissa. The warm coastal waters off southern Sri Lanka merge with the colder waters of the continental shelf just 10 nautical miles offshore, creating a cycle of rising nutrients that provide nourishment for millions of krill – the tiny crustacean that feeds some of the largest whales in the world.<br />
                                Sperm, fin, Bryde’s, humpback and even killer whales, as well as large pods of dolphins, are all seen regularly off the coast of Mirissa. But it’s the unrivalled prevalence of blue whales near Mirissa – and their accessibility – that places Sri Lanka at the top of the list of wildlife encounters that every person should try to experience.
