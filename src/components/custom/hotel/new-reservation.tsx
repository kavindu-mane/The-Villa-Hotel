          The importance of image processing and machine learning in the
          agricultural sector cannot be overstated. As global populations
          continue to rise, the demand for efficient and effective agricultural
          practices has become more critical than ever. Modern technologies such
          as image processing and machine learning offer promising solutions to
          various challenges faced by the agricultural industry, particularly in
          the domain of plant disease detection and management. Image processing
          involves the manipulation and analysis of images to extract meaningful
          information. In agriculture, this technology can be used to monitor
          crop health, identify disease symptoms, and even predict potential
          outbreaks. By analyzing images of plant leaves, stems, and fruits,
          image processing algorithms can detect subtle changes that may
          indicate the presence of a disease. This early detection is crucial
          for timely intervention and effective disease management. Machine
          learning, on the other hand, provides the computational power and
          algorithms needed to make sense of the vast amounts of data generated
          through image processing. Machine learning models can be trained to
          recognize patterns in the data, enabling them to identify diseases
          with high accuracy. These models can also learn from new data,
          continually improving their performance over time. The integration of
          image processing and machine learning in agriculture offers several
          benefits. First and foremost, it allows for the early detection of
          diseases, which is vital for preventing the spread of infections and
          minimizing crop losses. Early detection enables farmers to take
          corrective actions, such as applying targeted treatments or removing
          affected plants, before the disease can spread further. This proactive
          approach can significantly reduce the impact of diseases on crop yield
          and quality. Furthermore, these technologies can provide valuable
          insights into the health of crops and the effectiveness of various
          treatments. By analyzing images of plants over time, farmers can track
          the progress of diseases and assess the impact of different
          interventions. This data-driven approach enables more informed
          decision-making, leading to better outcomes for farmers and the
          agricultural industry as a whole. One of the key challenges in
          implementing these technologies is the need for accurate and reliable
          data. High-quality images are essential for effective image processing
          and machine learning. Factors such as lighting conditions, camera
          quality, and image resolution can all affect the accuracy of disease
          detection. Therefore, it is important to ensure that images are
          captured under consistent and optimal conditions. Another challenge is
          the development of robust machine learning models that can handle the
          variability and complexity of agricultural data. Plant diseases can
          manifest in various ways, and different crops may exhibit different
          symptoms for the same disease. Developing models that can accurately
          detect diseases across different crops and conditions requires
          extensive training data and sophisticated algorithms. Despite these
          challenges, the potential benefits of image processing and machine
          learning in agriculture are immense. Several studies have demonstrated
          the effectiveness of these technologies in detecting a wide range of
          plant diseases. For example, a study on corn leaf disease detection
          using image processing and support vector machines (SVM) achieved a
          high recognition rate of 93.7% on the training set and 89.38% on the
          test set. This demonstrates the potential of image processing and
          machine learning to provide accurate and reliable disease detection.
          Another study focused on the detection and classification of plant
          leaf diseases using digital image processing techniques. This
          comprehensive review highlighted the limitations of traditional manual
          inspection methods and emphasized the advantages of automated disease
          detection systems. The study also discussed the various challenges and
          future prospects in this field, underscoring the need for continued
          research and development. In addition to corn and general plant leaf
          diseases, specific crops such as grapes have also benefited from these
          technologies. A study on grape leaf disease identification using
          machine learning techniques achieved a testing accuracy of 93% using
          support vector machines (SVM). This further illustrates the potential
          of machine learning to accurately detect diseases in different crops.
          The application of image processing and machine learning is not
          limited to disease detection alone. These technologies can also be
          used to monitor other aspects of crop health, such as nutrient
          deficiencies, pest infestations, and environmental stress. By
          providing a comprehensive view of crop health, these technologies can
          help farmers optimize their management practices and improve overall
          crop productivity. Moreover, the use of image processing and machine
          learning in agriculture aligns with the broader trend towards
          precision agriculture. Precision agriculture involves the use of
          advanced technologies to monitor and manage crops at a fine scale. By
          providing detailed information on crop health and growth conditions,
          precision agriculture enables farmers to make more precise and
          targeted interventions. This can lead to more efficient use of
          resources, such as water and fertilizers, and ultimately result in
          higher yields and reduced environmental impact. The future of
          agriculture is undoubtedly intertwined with advancements in
          technology. As image processing and machine learning continue to
          evolve, their applications in agriculture are likely to expand. New
          algorithms and models will enable even more accurate and efficient
          disease detection, while improved imaging technologies will provide
          higher-quality data for analysis. Furthermore, the integration of
          these technologies with other agricultural innovations, such as drones
          and satellite imaging, will further enhance their capabilities. Drones
          equipped with advanced imaging sensors can capture high-resolution
          images of crops from above, providing a comprehensive view of large
          fields. Satellite imaging can offer a broader perspective, allowing
          for the monitoring of crop health over vast areas. In conclusion, the
          integration of image processing and machine learning in agriculture
          holds great promise for the future. These technologies offer powerful
          tools for early disease detection, informed decision-making, and
          optimized crop management. As research and development continue to
          advance, the agricultural industry will be better equipped to meet the
          challenges of feeding a growing global population. By harnessing the
          power of technology, we can ensure a more sustainable and productive
          future for agriculture. The journey towards fully realizing the
          potential of these technologies is still ongoing. Continued
          collaboration between researchers, farmers, and technology developers
          will be essential for overcoming the challenges and unlocking the full
          benefits of image processing and machine learning in agriculture. With
          sustained effort and innovation, we can look forward to a future where
          technology plays a central role in ensuring food security and
          agricultural sustainability. Agriculture is a field that has always
          been at the mercy of nature. Unpredictable weather patterns, pests,
          and diseases have historically posed significant challenges to
          farmers. However, with the advent of modern technology, farmers now
          have new tools at their disposal to combat these age-old problems.
          Image processing and machine learning are two such technologies that
          have shown great potential in revolutionizing the way we approach
          agriculture. Image processing involves analyzing and manipulating
          images to extract useful information. This can range from simple tasks
          like measuring the size of fruits to more complex analyses such as
          identifying disease symptoms in plants. Machine learning, on the other
          hand, involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data. When
          applied to agriculture, these technologies can help in early disease
          detection, monitoring crop health, and even predicting potential
          problems before they become severe. One of the primary advantages of
          using image processing and machine learning in agriculture is the
          ability to detect diseases early. Traditional methods of disease
          detection often rely on visual inspection by trained experts, which
          can be time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, image processing
          algorithms can analyze thousands of images quickly and objectively,
          identifying even subtle symptoms of disease. This early detection
          allows farmers to take action before the disease spreads, potentially
          saving entire crops. Machine learning algorithms can also be trained
          to recognize specific disease symptoms, making them highly effective
          in identifying a wide range of plant diseases. For example, a study on
          corn leaf disease detection using support vector machines (SVM)
          demonstrated high accuracy in identifying various diseases. Another
          study on grape leaf disease identification using machine learning
          techniques also achieved impressive results, further highlighting the
          potential of these technologies in agriculture. Beyond disease
          detection, image processing and machine learning can also be used to
          monitor overall crop health. By analyzing images over time, these
          technologies can track changes in plant growth and identify areas that
          may be under stress. This information can help farmers optimize their
          management practices, such as adjusting irrigation schedules or
          applying fertilizers more efficiently. Moreover, the use of these
          technologies aligns with the principles of precision agriculture.
          Precision agriculture involves using detailed data to manage crops
          more effectively, reducing waste and increasing efficiency. By
          providing precise information on crop health and growth conditions,
          image processing and machine learning enable farmers to make more
          informed decisions. This can lead to higher yields, better quality
          produce, and reduced environmental impact. Despite the promising
          potential of these technologies, there are still challenges to be
          addressed. High-quality data is essential for effective image
          processing and machine learning, and factors such as lighting
          conditions and image resolution can affect the accuracy of analyses.
          Developing robust algorithms that can handle the variability of
          real-world agricultural data is also a complex task. However, ongoing
          research and advancements in technology are continuously improving the
          capabilities of these tools. In conclusion, image processing and
          machine learning represent a significant advancement in agricultural
          technology. These tools offer new ways to detect diseases early,
          monitor crop health, and optimize farming practices. As research
          continues to advance, the agricultural industry will be better
          equipped to meet the challenges of the future, ensuring food security
          and sustainability for a growing global population. The integration of
          these technologies into everyday farming practices holds great
          promise, paving the way for a more efficient and productive
          agricultural sector. Agriculture has always been a field deeply
          intertwined with nature's unpredictability. Farmers have long battled
          against elements beyond their control, such as pests, diseases, and
          changing weather patterns. However, the advent of modern technology
          has ushered in a new era of agricultural practices. Among the most
          promising advancements are image processing and machine learning,
          which are poised to transform the way we approach farming. Image
          processing refers to the analysis and manipulation of images to
          extract meaningful information. In the context of agriculture, this
          technology can be used to monitor crop health, detect disease
          symptoms, and even predict potential outbreaks. By analyzing images of
          plant leaves, stems, and fruits, image processing algorithms can
          detect changes that may indicate the presence of a disease. This
          capability is crucial for timely intervention and effective disease
          management. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence,
          involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data. In
          agriculture, machine learning models can be trained to identify
          diseases with high accuracy, based on the data provided by image
          processing. These models improve over time as they learn from new
          data, continually enhancing their performance. In a dystopian America,
          a major source of entertainment is the Long Walk, in which 100 teenage
          boys walk without rest along U.S. Route 1. Each Walker must stay above
          four miles per hour. If a Walker drops below this speed for 30
          seconds, he gets a warning. A Walker can lose a warning if he walks
          for an hour without getting another warning. If a Walker gets three
          warnings and continues to lag behind for 30 seconds, he is shot dead
          by soldiers. The last surviving Walker earns a large sum of money and
          a "Prize" of his choice. Ray Garraty from Androscoggin County, Maine,
          arrives at the start of the Walk on the Canada-Maine border, where he
          meets several other Walkers such as the sardonic McVries, the friendly
          Baker, the cocky Olson and the enigmatic Stebbins. The Major, the
          leader of the secret police force known as the Squads, starts the
          Walk. Throughout the first day, Garraty befriends Baker, Olson, and
          several other Walkers such as Abraham and Pearson, growing
          particularly close to McVries and becoming particularly intrigued by
          Stebbins. A Walker named Barkovitch reveals to a reporter that he is
          in the Long Walk to "dance on the graves" of other participants, and
          later provokes another Walker into attacking him, resulting in the
          Walker's death and Barkovitch being ostracized. Garraty succeeds in
          surviving the night. Scramm, the odds-on favorite in Vegas, tells
          Garraty that he has a pregnant wife and so will have sufficient
          motivation to keep going. Garraty decides that his motivation will be
          surviving until Freeport as this will allow him to see his girlfriend
          Jan in the crowd. The Walkers begin to resent the Major, and McVries
          stops walking in an attempt to fight the soldiers, but is saved by
          Garraty. In return, McVries saves Garraty's life after Garraty
          experiences hysterics when the spectators increase in number. This
          camaraderie infuriates Olson, who is now severely fatigued and wants
          Garraty to die. Garraty reveals to the others that his father was
          Squaded, and a fight almost breaks out between McVries and another
          Walker, Collie Parker, when Parker claims that only "damn fools" are
          Squaded. Stebbins tells Garraty both that he believes he is going to
          win, and that the Walkers are all participating because they want to
          die. McVries and Baker both seem to be examples of this, due to
          McVries seeking pain and Baker's fascination with death; McVries also
          tells Garraty that he will sit down when he cannot walk any further.
          Stebbins also advises Garraty to watch Olson, who keeps walking
          despite being unresponsive. After Garraty brings Olson out of this
          state, Olson attacks the soldiers and is killed slowly and brutally.
          Scramm catches pneumonia and becomes unable to finish the Walk, and
          the other Walkers agree that the winner should provide financial
          security for Scramm's wife. Garraty asks Barkovitch to join the
          agreement, and Barkovitch agrees as he has become lonely and manic in
          his isolation from the others. Garraty also asks Stebbins, who tells
          Garraty that there was nothing special about Olson and that he was
          lying; Garraty, however, believes that Stebbins came to a realization
          that scared him. Scramm thanks the others and is killed in an act of
          defiance against the soldiers. After developing a charley horse,
          Garraty is given three warnings and has to walk for an hour to lose
          one. To distract himself, he tells McVries about how he felt a
          compulsion to join the Walk and that his mother was blinded by the
          thought of financial security. McVries reveals that he joined the Walk
          against the wishes of his family, and Abraham tells Garraty that he
          did not withdraw after being accepted due to the amusement it provided
          his town. Garraty begins to suffer from doubts about his sexuality and
          masculinity due to suppressed memories re-emerging, especially after
          McVries hints that he is sexually attracted to Garraty. This causes
          Garraty to lash out at a deteriorating Barkovitch, and Barkovitch
          commits suicide when the rest of the Walkers begin taunting him.
          Garraty wakes the next morning to find that many Walkers (including
          Pearson) have died overnight, as Barkovitch predicted. When the
          Walkers arrive in Freeport, Garraty attempts to die in Jan's arms but
          is saved by McVries. As a response, Abraham convinces the Walkers to
          make a promise to stop helping each other, which Garraty does
          reluctantly. This has disastrous consequences: Parker starts a
          revolution against the soldiers but is killed when nobody joins in;
          Abraham removes his shirt and catches pneumonia overnight because
          nobody can offer him a replacement, resulting in his death; Baker
          falls over and gains a severe nosebleed, and is given three warnings
          as nobody can help him up. On the morning of the fifth day, Stebbins
          reveals to Garraty and McVries that he is the Major's son, and that
          his Prize would be acceptance into the Major's household. However,
          Stebbins has become aware that the Major is using him as a "rabbit" to
          cause the Walk to last longer, which has worked, as seven Walkers make
          it into Massachusetts. Baker, now somewhat delirious and described as
          a "raw-blood machine", tells Garraty that he cannot walk any further
          and thanks Garraty for being his friend. Garraty unsuccessfully tries
          to talk him out of suicide. With Baker dead, the only remaining
          Walkers are Garraty, Stebbins and McVries. As Garraty tells him a
          fairy tale, McVries falls asleep and begins walking at the crowd, and
          Garraty breaks his promise and saves him; however, McVries chooses to
          sit down and die peacefully. A distraught Garraty is beckoned by a
          dark figure further ahead, and decides that he will give up because
          Stebbins cannot be beaten. When he tries to tell Stebbins, Stebbins
          clutches at him in horror and falls over dead. His corpse is shot when
          the Major arrives. This leaves Garraty the uncomprehending winner. He
          ignores the Major and approaches the dark figure (whom he believes to
          be another Walker), declaring that there is "still so far to walk".
          Garraty begins running after the figure. The significance of this
          study lies in its potential to advance the field of network intrusion
          detection by leveraging ensemble learning techniques to combine
          pre-trained DL and RL models. By addressing the current challenges in
          network intrusion detection, this research aims to achieve the
          following: 1. By evaluating how an ensemble model that integrates DL
          and RL performs in de tecting network intrusions, this study will
          provide valuable insights into the prac tical applicability and
          effectiveness of such models. This could lead to improved
          methodologies for identifying and mitigating network threats. 2.
          Through the optimization of the ensemble model by fine-tuning
          hyperparameters using existing benchmark datasets, this research aims
          to enhance the detection capabilities of network intrusion detection
          systems. This will ensure the model is well-calibrated to effectively
          identify and classify both known and novel threats. 3. By creating a
          model capable of adapting to new and evolving network threats, this
          research will contribute to the development of more robust and
          resilient net work intrusion detection systems that can effectively
          counteract sophisticated and previously unseen cyber-attack
          strategies. 4. This study will address existing gaps in the literature
          by providing a comprehensive analysis of the integration of DL and RL
          models through ensemble learning. By doing so, it will advance the
          understanding of the most effective techniques for com bining these
          models, contributing valuable knowledge to the field of cybersecurity
          research and development. 5. Utilizing well-known benchmark datasets
          such as CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS2017, and UNSW-NB15, this study will
          establish a standardized framework for evaluating the performance of
          network intrusion detection systems. This will facilitate the
          comparison of different approaches and promote the adoption of best
          practices in the industry. 4 6. Thefindings from this research can be
          directly applied to improve the network intru sion detection
          mechanisms used by various organizations, including governmental, f
          inancial, and healthcare institutions. Enhancing the overall security
          posture of these entities will contribute to a safer and more secure
          digital environment. Bycombining the strengths of DL and RL, the
          proposed research aims to provide a deeper understanding of ensemble
          learning techniques in network intrusion detection, ultimately leading
          to more effective strategies for safeguarding digital infrastructures
          against cyber threats. 1.5 Scope of the Study The scope of this study
          encompasses the investigation and evaluation of ensemble learn ing
          techniques for network intrusion detection, specifically focusing on
          the integration of pre-trained DL and RL models. This research will
          utilize publicly available benchmark datasets, including
          CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS2017, and UNSW-NB15, to ensure trans parency
          and reproducibility of results. The study will identify the
          best-performing DL and RL models for network intrusion detection from
          the last three years based on their F1 score and reproducibility. The
          research will develop an ensemble learning model that integrates the
          selected pre-trained DL and RL models, using the stacking method to
          combine their outputs. The performance of this ensemble model will be
          evaluated using standardized metrics such as precision, recall, F1
          score, and false positive rate, and compared against stan dalone DL
          and RL models. Cross-validation and ROC curves will be employed to
          provide comprehensive insights into model performance across different
          decision thresholds. Additionally, the study will involve fine-tuning
          the hyperparameters of the ensemble model using existing benchmark
          datasets to enhance detection capabilities. Random search will be
          utilized to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and optimize
          the model. Proportional stratified sampling will be employed as the
          sampling technique to ensure that the dataset is representative of
          various classes of network traffic, providing a robust foundation for
          training and evaluation. However, the study is limited by the datasets
          used, which may not capture the full diversity of network traffic and
          attack scenarios encountered in real-world environments. Computational
          resource constraints and time limitations may impact the extent of
          model 5 training and evaluation. The research will focus on specific
          DL and RL models identified through the literature review,
          acknowledging that other models not included in this study may also be
          effective for network intrusion detection. The ultimate goal of this
          study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness
          of ensemble learning techniques in network intrusion detection,
          contributing to the development of more robust and adaptable network
          security systems. 6 2 Literature Review 2.1 Main Discoveries in the
          Field The field of network intrusion detection has evolved
          considerably over the past few years, driven by advancements in DL and
          RL methodologies. Early IDS relied heavily on signature-based and
          anomaly-based techniques, which, while effective in specific scenar
          ios, often struggled with adaptability and scalability in the face of
          evolving cyber threats (Denning 1987). Deep learning models,
          particularly those utilizing architectures such as CNNs and RNNs, have
          demonstrated substantial improvements in intrusion detection
          capabilities. CNNs, traditionally used in image processing, have been
          effectively adapted to identify patterns in network traffic data,
          capturing spatial hierarchies and achieving high detection rates (Wang
          et al. 2017). RNNs, and their variants like LSTM networks, have been
          employed to model temporal dependencies in sequential data, proving
          particularly useful in detecting multi-step attack sequences and
          recognizing anomalies over time (Hnamte et al. 2023). Reinforcement
          learning has introduced a dynamic approach to intrusion detection by
          enabling systems to learn and adapt through interactions with the
          network environment. RL-based models, such as those employing
          Q-learning and DQN, have shown promise in optimizing detection
          strategies by continuously improving their performance based on
          feedback from the network’s response to various actions (Alavizadeh et
          al. 2022). These models can effectively handle the
          exploration-exploitation trade-off, crucial for identifying both known
          and novel threats. Recent research has explored ensemble learning
          techniques to combine the strengths of various ML models, thereby
          enhancing the overall detection accuracy and robustness of IDS.
          Ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting have been
          utilized to aggregate predictions from multiple models, mitigating
          individual weaknesses and reducing the likelihood of false positives
          and negatives (Thockchom et al. 2023). Key contributions in the field
          include the development of sophisticated DL architec tures that can
          process high-dimensional network traffic data, the application of RL
          for adaptive and real-time intrusion detection, and the integration of
          ensemble learning tech niques to enhance model robustness.
          Furthermore, advancements in feature extraction 7 and selection,
          leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and
          statis tical analysis, have significantly improved the
          interpretability and accuracy of IDS (Das et al. 2020). Overall, the
          confluence of DL, RL, and ensemble learning represents a significant
          leap forward in the capability to detect and mitigate network
          intrusions, providing more adaptive, accurate, and resilient IDS
          solutions. The ongoing research and development in this field continue
          to push the boundaries of what is possible in network security, paving
          the way for more secure and resilient information systems. 2.2 Current
          Discussions and Research Gaps Despite extensive research efforts in
          the field, the majority of existing studies have pri marily focused on
          ensemble approaches that combine similar types of models, such as DL
          with DL or CMLwith CML.However, a conspicuous gap exists in the
          literature regarding methodologies explicitly tailored to mitigate the
          shortcomings of standalone DL and RL approaches in intrusion
          detection. Dutta et al. (2020), Thockchom et al. (2023), and Imran et
          al. (2021) have delved into ensemble techniques that integrate various
          DL and ML models to bolster detection ac curacy. While commendable,
          these studies fall short of directly addressing the challenges
          intrinsic to standalone DL and RL methodologies. Similarly, research
          by Fitni & Ramli (2020) and Gao et al. (2019) underscores the
          significance of ensemble learning and feature selection in enhancing
          IDS performance. Nonetheless, their approaches, albeit effective,
          still rely on combinations of existing DL or ML algorithms without
          specifically targeting the limitations of standalone DL and RL models.
          In contrast, Rajadurai & Gandhi (2020) introduced a stacked ensemble
          learning model tailored for intrusion detection in wireless networks.
          While their model exhibited im proved performance compared to
          traditional methods, it predominantly focused on com bining gradient
          boosting machine and random forest algorithms, overlooking the unique
          challenges posed by standalone DL and RL approaches. 8 2.3 Importance
          for Current Investigation This study aims to address significant gaps
          in the field of network intrusion detection by evaluating and
          comparing the performance of various DL and RL models. By exploring
          both traditional and contemporary techniques, this research seeks to
          identify the most effective methods for detecting network intrusions.
          Furthermore, this study will develop an innovative ensemble learning
          technique to integrate the strengths of the best pre-trained DL and RL
          models. By leveraging a benchmark dataset, the research will aim to
          combine these models in a way that en hances overall detection
          capabilities, reduces false positives, and improves adaptability to
          evolving threats. The ensemble approach is anticipated to provide a
          more robust and reliable intrusion detection system compared to
          standalone models. This research also focuses on optimizing the
          ensemble model through fine-tuning hy perparameters, utilizing
          existing benchmark datasets and insights from the literature. By
          systematically refining these parameters, the study aims to enhance
          the precision, re call, F1 score, and reduce the false positive rate,
          ultimately leading to superior intrusion detection performance. The
          findings from this investigation will contribute to the broader field
          of network security by offering insights into the effectiveness of
          different DL and RL approaches, as well as the potential of ensemble
          learning techniques. This research underscores the importance of
          combining advanced machine learning models to develop adaptive and
          resilient intrusion detection systems. By addressing the challenges of
          current IDS, this study aims to significantly improve the detection
          and mitigation of network threats, thereby enhancing the security and
          reliability of networked systems. 9 3 Research Methodology 3.1
          Theoretical Background This study is grounded in the principles of
          ensemble learning, specifically focusing on combining pre-trained DL
          and RL models to enhance network intrusion detection. The theoretical
          framework builds upon key concepts such as model training,
          hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The integration of
          DL and RL models leverages their respective strengths—DL’s ability to
          identify patterns in data and RL’s adaptability to dynamic
          environments. This approach aims to address the limitations of using
          DL and RL models in isolation, such as high false positive rates and
          difficulties in handling large datasets due to the state explosion
          problem. The stacking method will be employed as the ensemble
          technique due to its capability to effectively combine diverse models.
          This involves training a meta-classifier on the out puts of the base
          models (DL and RL) to learn the best way to combine their predictions.
          The effectiveness of this method will be evaluated using standardized
          performance met rics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, providing a comprehensive assessment of the ensemble
          model’s capabilities. The significance of this study lies in its
          potential to advance the field of network intrusion detection by
          leveraging ensemble learning techniques to combine pre-trained DL and
          RL models. By addressing the current challenges in network intrusion
          detection, this research aims to achieve the following: 1. By

          models. This could lead to improved methodologies for identifying and
          mitigating network threats. 2. Through the optimization of the
          ensemble model by fine-tuning hyperparameters using existing benchmark
          datasets, this research aims to enhance the detection capabilities of
          network intrusion detection systems. This will ensure the model is
          well-calibrated to effectively identify and classify both known and
          novel threats. 3. By creating a model capable of adapting to new and
          evolving network threats, this research will contribute to the
          development of more robust and resilient net work intrusion detection
          systems that can effectively counteract sophisticated and previously
          unseen cyber-attack strategies. 4. This study will address existing
          gaps in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the
          integration of DL and RL models through ensemble learning. By doing
          so, it will advance the understanding of the most effective techniques
          for com bining these models, contributing valuable knowledge to the
          field of cybersecurity research and development. 5. Utilizing
          well-known benchmark datasets such as CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS2017,
          and UNSW-NB15, this study will establish a standardized framework for
          evaluating the performance of network intrusion detection systems.
          This will facilitate the comparison of different approaches and
          promote the adoption of best practices in the industry. 4 6.

          for adaptive and real-time intrusion detection, and the integration of
          ensemble learning tech niques to enhance model robustness.
          Furthermore, advancements in feature extraction 7 and selection,
          leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and
          statis tical analysis, have significantly improved the
          interpretability and accuracy of IDS (Das et al. 2020). Overall, the

          intrusions, providing more adaptive, accurate, and resilient IDS
          solutions. The ongoing research and development in this field continue
          to push the boundaries of what is possible in network security, paving
          the way for more secure and resilient information systems. 2.2 Current
          Discussions and Research Gaps Despite extensive research efforts in
          the field, the majority of existing studies have pri marily focused on
          ensemble approaches that combine similar types of models, such as DL
          with DL or CMLwith CML.However, a conspicuous gap exists in the
          literature regarding methodologies explicitly tailored to mitigate the
          shortcomings of standalone DL and RL approaches in intrusion
          detection. Dutta et al. (2020), Thockchom et al. (2023), and Imran et
          al. (2021) have delved into ensemble techniques that integrate various
          DL and ML models to bolster detection ac curacy. While commendable,
          these studies fall short of directly addressing the challenges
          intrinsic to standalone DL and RL methodologies. Similarly, research
          by Fitni & Ramli (2020) and Gao et al. (2019) underscores the
          significance of ensemble learning and feature selection in enhancing
          IDS performance. Nonetheless, their approaches, albeit effective,
          still rely on combinations of existing DL or ML algorithms without
          specifically targeting the limitations of standalone DL and RL models.
          In contrast, Rajadurai & Gandhi (2020) introduced a stacked ensemble
          learning model tailored for intrusion detection in wireless networks.
          While their model exhibited im proved performance compared to
          traditional methods, it predominantly focused on com bining gradient
          boosting machine and random forest algorithms, overlooking the unique
          challenges posed by standalone DL and RL approaches. 8 2.3 Importance
          for Current Investigation This study aims to address significant gaps
          in the field of network intrusion detection by evaluating and
          comparing the performance of various DL and RL models. By exploring
          both traditional and contemporary techniques, this research seeks to
          identify the most effective methods for detecting network intrusions.
          Furthermore, this study will develop an innovative ensemble learning
          technique to integrate the strengths of the best pre-trained DL and RL
          models. By leveraging a benchmark dataset, the research will aim to
          combine these models in a way that en hances overall detection
          capabilities, reduces false positives, and improves adaptability to
          evolving threats. The ensemble approach is anticipated to provide a
          more robust and reliable intrusion detection system compared to
          standalone models. This research also focuses on optimizing the
          ensemble model through fine-tuning hy perparameters, utilizing
          existing benchmark datasets and insights from the literature. By
          systematically refining these parameters, the study aims to enhance
          the precision, re call, F1 score, and reduce the false positive rate,
          ultimately leading to superior intrusion detection performance. The
          findings from this investigation will contribute to the broader field
          of network security by offering insights into the effectiveness of
          different DL and RL approaches, as well as the potential of ensemble
          learning techniques. This research underscores the importance of

          identify patterns in data and RL’s adaptability to dynamic
          environments. This approach aims to address the limitations of using
          DL and RL models in isolation, such as high false positive rates and
          difficulties in handling large datasets due to the state explosion

          datasets, this research aims to enhance the detection capabilities of
          network intrusion detection systems. This will ensure the model is
          well-calibrated to effectively identify and classify both known and
          novel threats. 3. By creating a model capable of adapting to new and

          for safeguarding digital infrastructures against cyber threats. 1.5
          Scope of the Study The scope of this study encompasses the
          investigation and evaluation of ensemble learn ing techniques for

          The study will identify the best-performing DL and RL models for
          network intrusion detection from the last three years based on their

          decision thresholds. Additionally, the study will involve fine-tuning
          the hyperparameters of the ensemble model using existing benchmark
          datasets to enhance detection capabilities. Random search will be
          utilized to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and optimize
          the model. Proportional stratified sampling will be employed as the
          sampling technique to ensure that the dataset is representative of
          various classes of network traffic, providing a robust foundation for
          training and evaluation. However, the study is limited by the datasets
          used, which may not capture the full diversity of network traffic and

          of ensemble learning techniques in network intrusion detection,
          contributing to the development of more robust and adaptable network
          security systems. 6 2 Literature Review 2.1 Main Discoveries in the
          Field The field of network intrusion detection has evolved
          considerably over the past few years, driven by advancements in DL and
          RL methodologies. Early IDS relied heavily on signature-based and
          anomaly-based techniques, which, while effective in specific scenar
          ios, often struggled with adaptability and scalability in the face of
          evolving cyber threats (Denning 1987). Deep learning models,
          particularly those utilizing architectures such as CNNs and RNNs, have
          demonstrated substantial improvements in intrusion detection
          capabilities. CNNs, traditionally used in image processing, have been
          effectively adapted to identify patterns in network traffic data,
          capturing spatial hierarchies and achieving high detection rates (Wang
          et al. 2017). RNNs, and their variants like LSTM networks, have been
          employed to model temporal dependencies in sequential data, proving
          particularly useful in detecting multi-step attack sequences and
          recognizing anomalies over time (Hnamte et al. 2023). Reinforcement
          learning has introduced a dynamic approach to intrusion detection by
          enabling systems to learn and adapt through interactions with the
          network environment. RL-based models, such as those employing
          Q-learning and DQN, have shown promise in optimizing detection
          strategies by continuously improving their performance based on
          feedback from the network’s response to various actions (Alavizadeh et
          al. 2022). These models can effectively handle the
          exploration-exploitation trade-off, crucial for identifying both known
          and novel threats. Recent research has explored ensemble learning
          techniques to combine the strengths of various ML models, thereby
          enhancing the overall detection accuracy and robustness of IDS.
          Ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting have been
          utilized to aggregate predictions from multiple models, mitigating
          individual weaknesses and reducing the likelihood of false positives
          and negatives (Thockchom et al. 2023). Key contributions in the field
          include the development of sophisticated DL architec tures that can
          process high-dimensional network traffic data, the application of RL
          for adaptive and real-time intrusion detection, and the integration of
          ensemble learning tech niques to enhance model robustness.
          Furthermore, advancements in feature extraction 7 and selection,
          leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and
          statis tical analysis, have significantly improved the

          leap forward in the capability to detect and mitigate network
          intrusions, providing more adaptive, accurate, and resilient IDS

          al. 2022). These models can effectively handle the
          exploration-exploitation trade-off, crucial for identifying both known
          and novel threats. Recent research has explored ensemble learning
          techniques to combine the strengths of various ML models, thereby
          enhancing the overall detection accuracy and robustness of IDS.
          Ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting have been
          utilized to aggregate predictions from multiple models, mitigating
          individual weaknesses and reducing the likelihood of false positives
          and negatives (Thockchom et al. 2023). Key contributions in the field
          include the development of sophisticated DL architec tures that can
          process high-dimensional network traffic data, the application of RL
          for adaptive and real-time intrusion detection, and the integration of
          ensemble learning tech niques to enhance model robustness.
          Furthermore, advancements in feature extraction 7 and selection,
          leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and
          statis tical analysis, have significantly improved the
          interpretability and accuracy of IDS (Das et al. 2020). Overall, the
          confluence of DL, RL, and ensemble learning represents a significant
          leap forward in the capability to detect and mitigate network
          intrusions, providing more adaptive, accurate, and resilient IDS
          solutions. The ongoing research and development in this field continue
          to push the boundaries of what is possible in network security, paving
          the way for more secure and resilient information systems. 2.2 Current
          Discussions and Research Gaps Despite extensive research efforts in
          the field, the majority of existing studies have pri marily focused on
          ensemble approaches that combine similar types of models, such as DL
          with DL or CMLwith CML.However, a conspicuous gap exists in the
          literature regarding methodologies explicitly tailored to mitigate the
          shortcomings of standalone DL and RL approaches in intrusion
          detection. Dutta et al. (2020), Thockchom et al. (2023), and Imran et
          al. (2021) have delved into ensemble techniques that integrate various
          DL and ML models to bolster detection ac curacy. While commendable,
          these studies fall short of directly addressing the challenges
          intrinsic to standalone DL and RL methodologies. Similarly, research
          by Fitni & Ramli (2020) and Gao et al. (2019) underscores the
          significance of ensemble learning and feature selection in enhancing
          IDS performance. Nonetheless, their approaches, albeit effective,
          still rely on combinations of existing DL or ML algorithms without
          specifically targeting the limitations of standalone DL and RL models.
          In contrast, Rajadurai & Gandhi (2020) introduced a stacked ensemble
          learning model tailored for intrusion detection in wireless networks.
          While their model exhibited im proved performance compared to
          traditional methods, it predominantly focused on com bining gradient
          boosting machine and random forest algorithms, overlooking the unique
          challenges posed by standalone DL and RL approaches. 8 2.3 Importance
          for Current Investigation This study aims to address significant gaps
          in the field of network intrusion detection by evaluating and
          comparing the performance of various DL and RL models. By exploring
          both traditional and contemporary techniques, this research seeks to
          identify the most effective methods for detecting network intrusions.
          Furthermore, this study will develop an innovative ensemble learning
          technique to integrate the strengths of the best pre-trained DL and RL
          models. By leveraging a benchmark dataset, the research will aim to
          combine these models in a way that en hances overall detection
          capabilities, reduces false positives, and improves adaptability to
          evolving threats. The ensemble approach is anticipated to provide a
          more robust and reliable intrusion detection system compared to
          standalone models. This research also focuses on optimizing the
          ensemble model through fine-tuning hy perparameters, utilizing
          existing benchmark datasets and insights from the literature. By
          systematically refining these parameters, the study aims to enhance
          the precision, re call, F1 score, and reduce the false positive rate,
          ultimately leading to superior intrusion detection performance. The
          findings from this investigation will contribute to the broader field
          of network security by offering insights into the effectiveness of
          different DL and RL approaches, as well as the potential of ensemble
          learning techniques. This research underscores the importance of
          combining advanced machine learning models to develop adaptive and

          DL and RL models leverages their respective strengths—DL’s ability to
          identify patterns in data and RL’s adaptability to dynamic
          environments. This approach aims to address the limitations of using
          DL and RL models in isolation, such as high false positive rates and
          difficulties in handling large datasets due to the state explosion
          problem. The stacking method will be employed as the ensemble
          technique due to its capability to effectively combine diverse models.
          This involves training a meta-classifier on the out puts of the base

          well-calibrated to effectively identify and classify both known and
          novel threats. 3. By creating a model capable of adapting to new and
          evolving network threats, this research will contribute to the
          development of more robust and resilient net work intrusion detection
          systems that can effectively counteract sophisticated and previously
          unseen cyber-attack strategies. 4. This study will address existing

          decision thresholds. Additionally, the study will involve fine-tuning
          the hyperparameters of the ensemble model using existing benchmark
          datasets to enhance detection capabilities. Random search will be
          utilized to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and optimize
          the model. Proportional stratified sampling will be employed as the
          sampling technique to ensure that the dataset is representative of
          various classes of network traffic, providing a robust foundation for
          training and evaluation. However, the study is limited by the datasets
          used, which may not capture the full diversity of network traffic and

          considerably over the past few years, driven by advancements in DL and

          ios, often struggled with adaptability and scalability in the face of
          evolving cyber threats (Denning 1987). Deep learning models,
          particularly those utilizing architectures such as CNNs and RNNs, have
          demonstrated substantial improvements in intrusion detection
          capabilities. CNNs, traditionally used in image processing, have been
          effectively adapted to identify patterns in network traffic data,
          capturing spatial hierarchies and achieving high detection rates (Wang
          et al. 2017). RNNs, and their variants like LSTM networks, have been
          employed to model temporal dependencies in sequential data, proving
          particularly useful in detecting multi-step attack sequences and
          recognizing anomalies over time (Hnamte et al. 2023). Reinforcement
          learning has introduced a dynamic approach to intrusion detection by
          enabling systems to learn and adapt through interactions with the
          network environment. RL-based models, such as those employing
          Q-learning and DQN, have shown promise in optimizing detection
          strategies by continuously improving their performance based on
          feedback from the network’s response to various actions (Alavizadeh et

          capturing spatial hierarchies and achieving high detection rates (Wang
          et al. 2017). RNNs, and their variants like LSTM networks, have been
          employed to model temporal dependencies in sequential data, proving
          particularly useful in detecting multi-step attack sequences and
          recognizing anomalies over time (Hnamte et al. 2023). Reinforcement
          learning has introduced a dynamic approach to intrusion detection by
          enabling systems to learn and adapt through interactions with the
          network environment. RL-based models, such as those employing
          Q-learning and DQN, have shown promise in optimizing detection
          strategies by continuously improving their performance based on
          feedback from the network’s response to various actions (Alavizadeh et
          al. 2022). These models can effectively handle the
          exploration-exploitation trade-off, crucial for identifying both known
          and novel threats. Recent research has explored ensemble learning
          techniques to combine the strengths of various ML models, thereby
          enhancing the overall detection accuracy and robustness of IDS.
          Ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting have been
          utilized to aggregate predictions from multiple models, mitigating
          individual weaknesses and reducing the likelihood of false positives
          and negatives (Thockchom et al. 2023). Key contributions in the field
          include the development of sophisticated DL architec tures that can
          process high-dimensional network traffic data, the application of RL
          for adaptive and real-time intrusion detection, and the integration of
          ensemble learning tech niques to enhance model robustness.
          Furthermore, advancements in feature extraction 7 and selection,
          leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and
          statis tical analysis, have significantly improved the
          interpretability and accuracy of IDS (Das et al. 2020). Overall, the
          confluence of DL, RL, and ensemble learning represents a significant
          leap forward in the capability to detect and mitigate network
          intrusions, providing more adaptive, accurate, and resilient IDS
          solutions. The ongoing research and development in this field continue
          to push the boundaries of what is possible in network security, paving
          the way for more secure and resilient information systems. 2.2 Current
          Discussions and Research Gaps Despite extensive research efforts in
          the field, the majority of existing studies have pri marily focused on
          ensemble approaches that combine similar types of models, such as DL
          with DL or CMLwith CML.However, a conspicuous gap exists in the
          literature regarding methodologies explicitly tailored to mitigate the
          shortcomings of standalone DL and RL approaches in intrusion
          detection. Dutta et al. (2020), Thockchom et al. (2023), and Imran et
          al. (2021) have delved into ensemble techniques that integrate various
          DL and ML models to bolster detection ac curacy. While commendable,
          these studies fall short of directly addressing the challenges
          intrinsic to standalone DL and RL methodologies. Similarly, research
          by Fitni & Ramli (2020) and Gao et al. (2019) underscores the
          significance of ensemble learning and feature selection in enhancing
          IDS performance. Nonetheless, their approaches, albeit effective,
          still rely on combinations of existing DL or ML algorithms without
          specifically targeting the limitations of standalone DL and RL models.
          In contrast, Rajadurai & Gandhi (2020) introduced a stacked ensemble
          learning model tailored for intrusion detection in wireless networks.
          While their model exhibited im proved performance compared to
          traditional methods, it predominantly focused on com bining gradient
          boosting machine and random forest algorithms, overlooking the unique
          challenges posed by standalone DL and RL approaches. 8 2.3 Importance
          for Current Investigation This study aims to address significant gaps
          in the field of network intrusion detection by evaluating and
          comparing the performance of various DL and RL models. By exploring
          both traditional and contemporary techniques, this research seeks to
          identify the most effective methods for detecting network intrusions.
          Furthermore, this study will develop an innovative ensemble learning
          technique to integrate the strengths of the best pre-trained DL and RL
          models. By leveraging a benchmark dataset, the research will aim to
          combine these models in a way that en hances overall detection
          capabilities, reduces false positives, and improves adaptability to
          evolving threats. The ensemble approach is anticipated to provide a
          more robust and reliable intrusion detection system compared to
          standalone models. This research also focuses on optimizing the
          ensemble model through fine-tuning hy perparameters, utilizing
          existing benchmark datasets and insights from the literature. By
          systematically refining these parameters, the study aims to enhance
          the precision, re call, F1 score, and reduce the false positive rate,
          ultimately leading to superior intrusion detection performance. The
          findings from this investigation will contribute to the broader field
          of network security by offering insights into the effectiveness of
          different DL and RL approaches, as well as the potential of ensemble
          learning techniques. This research underscores the importance of

          and RL models to enhance network intrusion detection. The theoretical
          framework builds upon key concepts such as model training,
          hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The integration of
          DL and RL models leverages their respective strengths—DL’s ability to
          identify patterns in data and RL’s adaptability to dynamic
          environments. This approach aims to address the limitations of using
          DL and RL models in isolation, such as high false positive rates and
          difficulties in handling large datasets due to the state explosion
          problem. The stacking method will be employed as the ensemble
          technique due to its capability to effectively combine diverse models.
          This involves training a meta-classifier on the out puts of the base
          models (DL and RL) to learn the best way to combine their predictions.
          The effectiveness of this method will be evaluated using standardized
          performance met rics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, providing a comprehensive assessment of the ensemble

          ensemble model by fine-tuning hyperparameters using existing benchmark
          datasets, this research aims to enhance the detection capabilities of
          network intrusion detection systems. This will ensure the model is
          well-calibrated to effectively identify and classify both known and
          novel threats. 3. By creating a model capable of adapting to new and
          evolving network threats, this research will contribute to the
          development of more robust and resilient net work intrusion detection
          systems that can effectively counteract sophisticated and previously
          unseen cyber-attack strategies. 4. This study will address existing
          gaps in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the
          integration of DL and RL models through ensemble learning. By doing
          so, it will advance the understanding of the most effective techniques
          for com bining these models, contributing valuable knowledge to the
          field of cybersecurity research and development. 5. Utilizing

          the hyperparameters of the ensemble model using existing benchmark
          datasets to enhance detection capabilities. Random search will be
          utilized to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and optimize
          the model. Proportional stratified sampling will be employed as the
          sampling technique to ensure that the dataset is representative of
          various classes of network traffic, providing a robust foundation for

          security systems. 6 2 Literature Review 2.1 Main Discoveries in the
          Field The field of network intrusion detection has evolved
          considerably over the past few years, driven by advancements in DL and
          RL methodologies. Early IDS relied heavily on signature-based and
          anomaly-based techniques, which, while effective in specific scenar
          ios, often struggled with adaptability and scalability in the face of
          evolving cyber threats (Denning 1987). Deep learning models,
          particularly those utilizing architectures such as CNNs and RNNs, have
          demonstrated substantial improvements in intrusion detection
          capabilities. CNNs, traditionally used in image processing, have been

          security systems. 6 2 Literature Review 2.1 Main Discoveries in the
          Field The field of network intrusion detection has evolved
          considerably over the past few years, driven by advancements in DL and
          RL methodologies. Early IDS relied heavily on signature-based and
          anomaly-based techniques, which, while effective in specific scenar
          ios, often struggled with adaptability and scalability in the face of
          evolving cyber threats (Denning 1987). Deep learning models,
          particularly those utilizing architectures such as CNNs and RNNs, have
          demonstrated substantial improvements in intrusion detection
          capabilities. CNNs, traditionally used in image processing, have been
          effectively adapted to identify patterns in network traffic data,
          capturing spatial hierarchies and achieving high detection rates (Wang
          et al. 2017). RNNs, and their variants like LSTM networks, have been
          employed to model temporal dependencies in sequential data, proving
          particularly useful in detecting multi-step attack sequences and
          recognizing anomalies over time (Hnamte et al. 2023). Reinforcement
          learning has introduced a dynamic approach to intrusion detection by
          enabling systems to learn and adapt through interactions with the
          network environment. RL-based models, such as those employing
          Q-learning and DQN, have shown promise in optimizing detection
          strategies by continuously improving their performance based on
          feedback from the network’s response to various actions (Alavizadeh et
          al. 2022). These models can effectively handle the
          exploration-exploitation trade-off, crucial for identifying both known
          and novel threats. Recent research has explored ensemble learning
          techniques to combine the strengths of various ML models, thereby
          enhancing the overall detection accuracy and robustness of IDS.
          Ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting have been
          utilized to aggregate predictions from multiple models, mitigating
          individual weaknesses and reducing the likelihood of false positives
          and negatives (Thockchom et al. 2023). Key contributions in the field
          include the development of sophisticated DL architec tures that can
          process high-dimensional network traffic data, the application of RL
          for adaptive and real-time intrusion detection, and the integration of
          ensemble learning tech niques to enhance model robustness.
          Furthermore, advancements in feature extraction 7 and selection,
          leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and
          statis tical analysis, have significantly improved the
          interpretability and accuracy of IDS (Das et al. 2020). Overall, the
          confluence of DL, RL, and ensemble learning represents a significant
          leap forward in the capability to detect and mitigate network
          intrusions, providing more adaptive, accurate, and resilient IDS
          solutions. The ongoing research and development in this field continue
          to push the boundaries of what is possible in network security, paving
          the way for more secure and resilient information systems. 2.2 Current
          Discussions and Research Gaps Despite extensive research efforts in
          the field, the majority of existing studies have pri marily focused on
          ensemble approaches that combine similar types of models, such as DL
          with DL or CMLwith CML.However, a conspicuous gap exists in the
          literature regarding methodologies explicitly tailored to mitigate the
          shortcomings of standalone DL and RL approaches in intrusion
          detection. Dutta et al. (2020), Thockchom et al. (2023), and Imran et
          al. (2021) have delved into ensemble techniques that integrate various
          DL and ML models to bolster detection ac curacy. While commendable,
          these studies fall short of directly addressing the challenges
          intrinsic to standalone DL and RL methodologies. Similarly, research
          by Fitni & Ramli (2020) and Gao et al. (2019) underscores the
          significance of ensemble learning and feature selection in enhancing
          IDS performance. Nonetheless, their approaches, albeit effective,
          still rely on combinations of existing DL or ML algorithms without
          specifically targeting the limitations of standalone DL and RL models.
          In contrast, Rajadurai & Gandhi (2020) introduced a stacked ensemble
          learning model tailored for intrusion detection in wireless networks.
          While their model exhibited im proved performance compared to
          traditional methods, it predominantly focused on com bining gradient
          boosting machine and random forest algorithms, overlooking the unique
          challenges posed by standalone DL and RL approaches. 8 2.3 Importance
          for Current Investigation This study aims to address significant gaps
          in the field of network intrusion detection by evaluating and
          comparing the performance of various DL and RL models. By exploring
          both traditional and contemporary techniques, this research seeks to
          identify the most effective methods for detecting network intrusions.
          Furthermore, this study will develop an innovative ensemble learning
          technique to integrate the strengths of the best pre-trained DL and RL
          models. By leveraging a benchmark dataset, the research will aim to
          combine these models in a way that en hances overall detection
          capabilities, reduces false positives, and improves adaptability to
          evolving threats. The ensemble approach is anticipated to provide a
          more robust and reliable intrusion detection system compared to
          standalone models. This research also focuses on optimizing the
          ensemble model through fine-tuning hy perparameters, utilizing
          existing benchmark datasets and insights from the literature. By
          systematically refining these parameters, the study aims to enhance
          the precision, re call, F1 score, and reduce the false positive rate,
          ultimately leading to superior intrusion detection performance. The
          findings from this investigation will contribute to the broader field
          of network security by offering insights into the effectiveness of
          different DL and RL approaches, as well as the potential of ensemble
          learning techniques. This research underscores the importance of
          combining advanced machine learning models to develop adaptive and
          resilient intrusion detection systems. By addressing the challenges of
          current IDS, this study aims to significantly improve the detection
          and mitigation of network threats, thereby enhancing the security and
          reliability of networked systems. 9 3 Research Methodology 3.1
          Theoretical Background This study is grounded in the principles of
          ensemble learning, specifically focusing on combining pre-trained DL
          and RL models to enhance network intrusion detection. The theoretical
          framework builds upon key concepts such as model training,
          hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The integration of
          DL and RL models leverages their respective strengths—DL’s ability to
          identify patterns in data and RL’s adaptability to dynamic
          environments. This approach aims to address the limitations of using
          DL and RL models in isolation, such as high false positive rates and
          difficulties in handling large datasets due to the state explosion
          problem. The stacking method will be employed as the ensemble
          technique due to its capability to effectively combine diverse models.
          This involves training a meta-classifier on the out puts of the base
          models (DL and RL) to learn the best way to combine their predictions.
          The effectiveness of this method will be evaluated using standardized
          performance met rics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, providing a comprehensive assessment of the ensemble
          model’s capabilities. The significance of this study lies in its
          potential to advance the field of network intrusion detection by
          leveraging ensemble learning techniques to combine pre-trained DL and
          RL models. By addressing the current challenges in network intrusion
          detection, this research aims to achieve the following: 1. By
          evaluating how an ensemble model that integrates DL and RL performs in
          de tecting network intrusions, this study will provide valuable
          insights into the prac tical applicability and effectiveness of such
          models. This could lead to improved methodologies for identifying and
          mitigating network threats. 2. Through the optimization of the
          ensemble model by fine-tuning hyperparameters using existing benchmark
          datasets, this research aims to enhance the detection capabilities of
          network intrusion detection systems. This will ensure the model is
          well-calibrated to effectively identify and classify both known and
          novel threats. 3. By creating a model capable of adapting to new and
          evolving network threats, this research will contribute to the
          development of more robust and resilient net work intrusion detection
          systems that can effectively counteract sophisticated and previously
          unseen cyber-attack strategies. 4. This study will address existing
          gaps in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the
          integration of DL and RL models through ensemble learning. By doing
          so, it will advance the understanding of the most effective techniques
          for com bining these models, contributing valuable knowledge to the
          field of cybersecurity research and development. 5. Utilizing
          well-known benchmark datasets such as CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS2017,
          and UNSW-NB15, this study will establish a standardized framework for
          evaluating the performance of network intrusion detection systems.
          This will facilitate the comparison of different approaches and
          promote the adoption of best practices in the industry. 4 6.
          Thefindings from this research can be directly applied to improve the
          network intru sion detection mechanisms used by various organizations,
          including governmental, f inancial, and healthcare institutions.
          Enhancing the overall security posture of these entities will
          contribute to a safer and more secure digital environment. Bycombining
          the strengths of DL and RL, the proposed research aims to provide a
          deeper understanding of ensemble learning techniques in network
          intrusion detection, ultimately leading to more effective strategies
          for safeguarding digital infrastructures against cyber threats. 1.5
          Scope of the Study The scope of this study encompasses the
          investigation and evaluation of ensemble learn ing techniques for
          network intrusion detection, specifically focusing on the integration
          of pre-trained DL and RL models. This research will utilize publicly
          available benchmark datasets, including CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS2017,
          and UNSW-NB15, to ensure trans parency and reproducibility of results.
          The study will identify the best-performing DL and RL models for
          network intrusion detection from the last three years based on their
          F1 score and reproducibility. The research will develop an ensemble
          learning model that integrates the selected pre-trained DL and RL
          models, using the stacking method to combine their outputs. The
          performance of this ensemble model will be evaluated using
          standardized metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, and compared against stan dalone DL and RL models.
          Cross-validation and ROC curves will be employed to provide
          comprehensive insights into model performance across different
          decision thresholds. Additionally, the study will involve fine-tuning
          the hyperparameters of the ensemble model using existing benchmark
          datasets to enhance detection capabilities. Random search will be
          utilized to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and optimize
          the model. Proportional stratified sampling will be employed as the
          sampling technique to ensure that the dataset is representative of
          various classes of network traffic, providing a robust foundation for
          training and evaluation. However, the study is limited by the datasets
          used, which may not capture the full diversity of network traffic and
          attack scenarios encountered in real-world environments. Computational
          resource constraints and time limitations may impact the extent of
          model 5 training and evaluation. The research will focus on specific
          DL and RL models identified through the literature review,
          acknowledging that other models not included in this study may also be
          effective for network intrusion detection. The ultimate goal of this
          study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness
          of ensemble learning techniques in network intrusion detection,
          contributing to the development of more robust and adaptable network

          used, which may not capture the full diversity of network traffic and
          attack scenarios encountered in real-world environments. Computational
          resource constraints and time limitations may impact the extent of
          model 5 training and evaluation. The research will focus on specific
          DL and RL models identified through the literature review,
          acknowledging that other models not included in this study may also be
          effective for network intrusion detection. The ultimate goal of this
          study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness
          of ensemble learning techniques in network intrusion detection,
          contributing to the development of more robust and adaptable network
          security systems. 6 2 Literature Review 2.1 Main Discoveries in the
          Field The field of network intrusion detection has evolved
          considerably over the past few years, driven by advancements in DL and
          RL methodologies. Early IDS relied heavily on signature-based and
          anomaly-based techniques, which, while effective in specific scenar
          ios, often struggled with adaptability and scalability in the face of
          evolving cyber threats (Denning 1987). Deep learning models,
          particularly those utilizing architectures such as CNNs and RNNs, have
          demonstrated substantial improvements in intrusion detection
          capabilities. CNNs, traditionally used in image processing, have been
          effectively adapted to identify patterns in network traffic data,
          capturing spatial hierarchies and achieving high detection rates (Wang
          et al. 2017). RNNs, and their variants like LSTM networks, have been
          employed to model temporal dependencies in sequential data, proving
          particularly useful in detecting multi-step attack sequences and
          recognizing anomalies over time (Hnamte et al. 2023). Reinforcement
          learning has introduced a dynamic approach to intrusion detection by
          enabling systems to learn and adapt through interactions with the
          network environment. RL-based models, such as those employing
          Q-learning and DQN, have shown promise in optimizing detection
          strategies by continuously improving their performance based on
          feedback from the network’s response to various actions (Alavizadeh et
          al. 2022). These models can effectively handle the
          exploration-exploitation trade-off, crucial for identifying both known
          and novel threats. Recent research has explored ensemble learning
          techniques to combine the strengths of various ML models, thereby
          enhancing the overall detection accuracy and robustness of IDS.
          Ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting have been
          utilized to aggregate predictions from multiple models, mitigating
          individual weaknesses and reducing the likelihood of false positives
          and negatives (Thockchom et al. 2023). Key contributions in the field
          include the development of sophisticated DL architec tures that can
          process high-dimensional network traffic data, the application of RL
          for adaptive and real-time intrusion detection, and the integration of
          ensemble learning tech niques to enhance model robustness.
          Furthermore, advancements in feature extraction 7 and selection,
          leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and
          statis tical analysis, have significantly improved the
          interpretability and accuracy of IDS (Das et al. 2020). Overall, the
          confluence of DL, RL, and ensemble learning represents a significant
          leap forward in the capability to detect and mitigate network
          intrusions, providing more adaptive, accurate, and resilient IDS
          solutions. The ongoing research and development in this field continue
          to push the boundaries of what is possible in network security, paving
          the way for more secure and resilient information systems. 2.2 Current
          Discussions and Research Gaps Despite extensive research efforts in
          the field, the majority of existing studies have pri marily focused on
          ensemble approaches that combine similar types of models, such as DL
          with DL or CMLwith CML.However, a conspicuous gap exists in the
          literature regarding methodologies explicitly tailored to mitigate the
          shortcomings of standalone DL and RL approaches in intrusion
          detection. Dutta et al. (2020), Thockchom et al. (2023), and Imran et
          al. (2021) have delved into ensemble techniques that integrate various
          DL and ML models to bolster detection ac curacy. While commendable,
          these studies fall short of directly addressing the challenges
          intrinsic to standalone DL and RL methodologies. Similarly, research
          by Fitni & Ramli (2020) and Gao et al. (2019) underscores the
          significance of ensemble learning and feature selection in enhancing
          IDS performance. Nonetheless, their approaches, albeit effective,
          still rely on combinations of existing DL or ML algorithms without
          specifically targeting the limitations of standalone DL and RL models.
          In contrast, Rajadurai & Gandhi (2020) introduced a stacked ensemble
          learning model tailored for intrusion detection in wireless networks.
          While their model exhibited im proved performance compared to
          traditional methods, it predominantly focused on com bining gradient
          boosting machine and random forest algorithms, overlooking the unique
          challenges posed by standalone DL and RL approaches. 8 2.3 Importance
          for Current Investigation This study aims to address significant gaps
          in the field of network intrusion detection by evaluating and
          comparing the performance of various DL and RL models. By exploring
          both traditional and contemporary techniques, this research seeks to
          identify the most effective methods for detecting network intrusions.
          Furthermore, this study will develop an innovative ensemble learning
          technique to integrate the strengths of the best pre-trained DL and RL
          models. By leveraging a benchmark dataset, the research will aim to
          combine these models in a way that en hances overall detection
          capabilities, reduces false positives, and improves adaptability to
          evolving threats. The ensemble approach is anticipated to provide a
          more robust and reliable intrusion detection system compared to
          standalone models. This research also focuses on optimizing the
          ensemble model through fine-tuning hy perparameters, utilizing
          existing benchmark datasets and insights from the literature. By
          systematically refining these parameters, the study aims to enhance
          the precision, re call, F1 score, and reduce the false positive rate,
          ultimately leading to superior intrusion detection performance. The
          findings from this investigation will contribute to the broader field
          of network security by offering insights into the effectiveness of
          different DL and RL approaches, as well as the potential of ensemble
          learning techniques. This research underscores the importance of
          combining advanced machine learning models to develop adaptive and
          resilient intrusion detection systems. By addressing the challenges of
          current IDS, this study aims to significantly improve the detection
          and mitigation of network threats, thereby enhancing the security and
          reliability of networked systems. 9 3 Research Methodology 3.1
          Theoretical Background This study is grounded in the principles of
          ensemble learning, specifically focusing on combining pre-trained DL
          and RL models to enhance network intrusion detection. The theoretical
          framework builds upon key concepts such as model training,
          hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The integration of
          DL and RL models leverages their respective strengths—DL’s ability to
          identify patterns in data and RL’s adaptability to dynamic
          environments. This approach aims to address the limitations of using
          DL and RL models in isolation, such as high false positive rates and
          difficulties in handling large datasets due to the state explosion
          problem. The stacking method will be employed as the ensemble
          technique due to its capability to effectively combine diverse models.
          This involves training a meta-classifier on the out puts of the base
          models (DL and RL) to learn the best way to combine their predictions.
          The effectiveness of this method will be evaluated using standardized
          performance met rics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, providing a comprehensive assessment of the ensemble
          model’s capabilities. The significance of this study lies in its
          potential to advance the field of network intrusion detection by
          leveraging ensemble learning techniques to combine pre-trained DL and
          RL models. By addressing the current challenges in network intrusion
          detection, this research aims to achieve the following: 1. By
          evaluating how an ensemble model that integrates DL and RL performs in
          de tecting network intrusions, this study will provide valuable
          insights into the prac tical applicability and effectiveness of such
          models. This could lead to improved methodologies for identifying and
          mitigating network threats. 2. Through the optimization of the
          ensemble model by fine-tuning hyperparameters using existing benchmark
          datasets, this research aims to enhance the detection capabilities of
          network intrusion detection systems. This will ensure the model is
          well-calibrated to effectively identify and classify both known and
          novel threats. 3. By creating a model capable of adapting to new and
          evolving network threats, this research will contribute to the
          development of more robust and resilient net work intrusion detection
          systems that can effectively counteract sophisticated and previously
          unseen cyber-attack strategies. 4. This study will address existing
          gaps in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the
          integration of DL and RL models through ensemble learning. By doing
          so, it will advance the understanding of the most effective techniques
          for com bining these models, contributing valuable knowledge to the
          field of cybersecurity research and development. 5. Utilizing
          well-known benchmark datasets such as CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS2017,
          and UNSW-NB15, this study will establish a standardized framework for
          evaluating the performance of network intrusion detection systems.
          This will facilitate the comparison of different approaches and
          promote the adoption of best practices in the industry. 4 6.

          Enhancing the overall security posture of these entities will
          contribute to a safer and more secure digital environment. Bycombining

          standardized metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, and compared against stan dalone DL and RL models.
          Cross-validation and ROC curves will be employed to provide
          comprehensive insights into model performance across different
          decision thresholds. Additionally, the study will involve fine-tuning
          the hyperparameters of the ensemble model using existing benchmark
          datasets to enhance detection capabilities. Random search will be
          utilized to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and optimize
          the model. Proportional stratified sampling will be employed as the
          sampling technique to ensure that the dataset is representative of
          various classes of network traffic, providing a robust foundation for
          training and evaluation. However, the study is limited by the datasets

          standardized metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, and compared against stan dalone DL and RL models.
          Cross-validation and ROC curves will be employed to provide
          comprehensive insights into model performance across different
          decision thresholds. Additionally, the study will involve fine-tuning
          the hyperparameters of the ensemble model using existing benchmark
          datasets to enhance detection capabilities. Random search will be
          utilized to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and optimize
          the model. Proportional stratified sampling will be employed as the
          sampling technique to ensure that the dataset is representative of
          various classes of network traffic, providing a robust foundation for
          training and evaluation. However, the study is limited by the datasets
          used, which may not capture the full diversity of network traffic and
          attack scenarios encountered in real-world environments. Computational
          resource constraints and time limitations may impact the extent of
          model 5 training and evaluation. The research will focus on specific
          DL and RL models identified through the literature review,
          acknowledging that other models not included in this study may also be
          effective for network intrusion detection. The ultimate goal of this
          study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness
          of ensemble learning techniques in network intrusion detection,
          contributing to the development of more robust and adaptable network
          security systems. 6 2 Literature Review 2.1 Main Discoveries in the
          Field The field of network intrusion detection has evolved
          considerably over the past few years, driven by advancements in DL and
          RL methodologies. Early IDS relied heavily on signature-based and
          anomaly-based techniques, which, while effective in specific scenar
          ios, often struggled with adaptability and scalability in the face of
          evolving cyber threats (Denning 1987). Deep learning models,
          particularly those utilizing architectures such as CNNs and RNNs, have
          demonstrated substantial improvements in intrusion detection
          capabilities. CNNs, traditionally used in image processing, have been
          effectively adapted to identify patterns in network traffic data,
          capturing spatial hierarchies and achieving high detection rates (Wang
          et al. 2017). RNNs, and their variants like LSTM networks, have been
          employed to model temporal dependencies in sequential data, proving
          particularly useful in detecting multi-step attack sequences and
          recognizing anomalies over time (Hnamte et al. 2023). Reinforcement
          learning has introduced a dynamic approach to intrusion detection by
          enabling systems to learn and adapt through interactions with the
          network environment. RL-based models, such as those employing
          Q-learning and DQN, have shown promise in optimizing detection
          strategies by continuously improving their performance based on
          feedback from the network’s response to various actions (Alavizadeh et
          al. 2022). These models can effectively handle the
          exploration-exploitation trade-off, crucial for identifying both known
          and novel threats. Recent research has explored ensemble learning
          techniques to combine the strengths of various ML models, thereby
          enhancing the overall detection accuracy and robustness of IDS.
          Ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting have been
          utilized to aggregate predictions from multiple models, mitigating
          individual weaknesses and reducing the likelihood of false positives
          and negatives (Thockchom et al. 2023). Key contributions in the field
          include the development of sophisticated DL architec tures that can
          process high-dimensional network traffic data, the application of RL
          for adaptive and real-time intrusion detection, and the integration of
          ensemble learning tech niques to enhance model robustness.
          Furthermore, advancements in feature extraction 7 and selection,
          leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and
          statis tical analysis, have significantly improved the
          interpretability and accuracy of IDS (Das et al. 2020). Overall, the
          confluence of DL, RL, and ensemble learning represents a significant
          leap forward in the capability to detect and mitigate network
          intrusions, providing more adaptive, accurate, and resilient IDS
          solutions. The ongoing research and development in this field continue
          to push the boundaries of what is possible in network security, paving
          the way for more secure and resilient information systems. 2.2 Current
          Discussions and Research Gaps Despite extensive research efforts in
          the field, the majority of existing studies have pri marily focused on
          ensemble approaches that combine similar types of models, such as DL
          with DL or CMLwith CML.However, a conspicuous gap exists in the
          literature regarding methodologies explicitly tailored to mitigate the
          shortcomings of standalone DL and RL approaches in intrusion
          detection. Dutta et al. (2020), Thockchom et al. (2023), and Imran et
          al. (2021) have delved into ensemble techniques that integrate various
          DL and ML models to bolster detection ac curacy. While commendable,
          these studies fall short of directly addressing the challenges
          intrinsic to standalone DL and RL methodologies. Similarly, research
          by Fitni & Ramli (2020) and Gao et al. (2019) underscores the
          significance of ensemble learning and feature selection in enhancing
          IDS performance. Nonetheless, their approaches, albeit effective,
          still rely on combinations of existing DL or ML algorithms without
          specifically targeting the limitations of standalone DL and RL models.
          In contrast, Rajadurai & Gandhi (2020) introduced a stacked ensemble
          learning model tailored for intrusion detection in wireless networks.
          While their model exhibited im proved performance compared to
          traditional methods, it predominantly focused on com bining gradient
          boosting machine and random forest algorithms, overlooking the unique
          challenges posed by standalone DL and RL approaches. 8 2.3 Importance
          for Current Investigation This study aims to address significant gaps
          in the field of network intrusion detection by evaluating and
          comparing the performance of various DL and RL models. By exploring
          both traditional and contemporary techniques, this research seeks to
          identify the most effective methods for detecting network intrusions.
          Furthermore, this study will develop an innovative ensemble learning
          technique to integrate the strengths of the best pre-trained DL and RL
          models. By leveraging a benchmark dataset, the research will aim to
          combine these models in a way that en hances overall detection
          capabilities, reduces false positives, and improves adaptability to
          evolving threats. The ensemble approach is anticipated to provide a
          more robust and reliable intrusion detection system compared to
          standalone models. This research also focuses on optimizing the
          ensemble model through fine-tuning hy perparameters, utilizing
          existing benchmark datasets and insights from the literature. By
          systematically refining these parameters, the study aims to enhance
          the precision, re call, F1 score, and reduce the false positive rate,
          ultimately leading to superior intrusion detection performance. The
          findings from this investigation will contribute to the broader field
          of network security by offering insights into the effectiveness of
          different DL and RL approaches, as well as the potential of ensemble
          learning techniques. This research underscores the importance of
          combining advanced machine learning models to develop adaptive and
          resilient intrusion detection systems. By addressing the challenges of
          current IDS, this study aims to significantly improve the detection
          and mitigation of network threats, thereby enhancing the security and
          reliability of networked systems. 9 3 Research Methodology 3.1
          Theoretical Background This study is grounded in the principles of
          ensemble learning, specifically focusing on combining pre-trained DL
          and RL models to enhance network intrusion detection. The theoretical
          framework builds upon key concepts such as model training,
          hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The integration of
          DL and RL models leverages their respective strengths—DL’s ability to
          identify patterns in data and RL’s adaptability to dynamic
          environments. This approach aims to address the limitations of using
          DL and RL models in isolation, such as high false positive rates and
          difficulties in handling large datasets due to the state explosion
          problem. The stacking method will be employed as the ensemble
          technique due to its capability to effectively combine diverse models.
          This involves training a meta-classifier on the out puts of the base
          models (DL and RL) to learn the best way to combine their predictions.
          The effectiveness of this method will be evaluated using standardized
          performance met rics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, providing a comprehensive assessment of the ensemble
          model’s capabilities. The significance of this study lies in its
          potential to advance the field of network intrusion detection by
          leveraging ensemble learning techniques to combine pre-trained DL and

          detection, this research aims to achieve the following: 1. By
          evaluating how an ensemble model that integrates DL and RL performs in
          de tecting network intrusions, this study will provide valuable
          insights into the prac tical applicability and effectiveness of such
          models. This could lead to improved methodologies for identifying and
          mitigating network threats. 2. Through the optimization of the
          ensemble model by fine-tuning hyperparameters using existing benchmark
          datasets, this research aims to enhance the detection capabilities of
          network intrusion detection systems. This will ensure the model is
          well-calibrated to effectively identify and classify both known and
          novel threats. 3. By creating a model capable of adapting to new and
          evolving network threats, this research will contribute to the
          development of more robust and resilient net work intrusion detection
          systems that can effectively counteract sophisticated and previously
          unseen cyber-attack strategies. 4. This study will address existing
          gaps in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the
          integration of DL and RL models through ensemble learning. By doing
          so, it will advance the understanding of the most effective techniques
          for com bining these models, contributing valuable knowledge to the
          field of cybersecurity research and development. 5. Utilizing
          well-known benchmark datasets such as CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS2017,
          and UNSW-NB15, this study will establish a standardized framework for
          evaluating the performance of network intrusion detection systems.
          This will facilitate the comparison of different approaches and
          promote the adoption of best practices in the industry. 4 6.

          network intrusion detection, specifically focusing on the integration
          of pre-trained DL and RL models. This research will utilize publicly
          available benchmark datasets, including CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS2017,
          and UNSW-NB15, to ensure trans parency and reproducibility of results.
          The study will identify the best-performing DL and RL models for
          network intrusion detection from the last three years based on their
          F1 score and reproducibility. The research will develop an ensemble
          learning model that integrates the selected pre-trained DL and RL
          models, using the stacking method to combine their outputs. The
          performance of this ensemble model will be evaluated using
          standardized metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, and compared against stan dalone DL and RL models.
          Cross-validation and ROC curves will be employed to provide
          comprehensive insights into model performance across different
          decision thresholds. Additionally, the study will involve fine-tuning
          the hyperparameters of the ensemble model using existing benchmark
          datasets to enhance detection capabilities. Random search will be
          utilized to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and optimize
          the model. Proportional stratified sampling will be employed as the
          sampling technique to ensure that the dataset is representative of
          various classes of network traffic, providing a robust foundation for
          training and evaluation. However, the study is limited by the datasets
          used, which may not capture the full diversity of network traffic and
          attack scenarios encountered in real-world environments. Computational
          resource constraints and time limitations may impact the extent of
          model 5 training and evaluation. The research will focus on specific
          DL and RL models identified through the literature review,
          acknowledging that other models not included in this study may also be
          effective for network intrusion detection. The ultimate goal of this
          study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness
          of ensemble learning techniques in network intrusion detection,
          contributing to the development of more robust and adaptable network
          security systems. 6 2 Literature Review 2.1 Main Discoveries in the
          Field The field of network intrusion detection has evolved
          considerably over the past few years, driven by advancements in DL and
          RL methodologies. Early IDS relied heavily on signature-based and
          anomaly-based techniques, which, while effective in specific scenar
          ios, often struggled with adaptability and scalability in the face of
          evolving cyber threats (Denning 1987). Deep learning models,
          particularly those utilizing architectures such as CNNs and RNNs, have
          demonstrated substantial improvements in intrusion detection
          capabilities. CNNs, traditionally used in image processing, have been
          effectively adapted to identify patterns in network traffic data,
          capturing spatial hierarchies and achieving high detection rates (Wang
          et al. 2017). RNNs, and their variants like LSTM networks, have been
          employed to model temporal dependencies in sequential data, proving
          particularly useful in detecting multi-step attack sequences and
          recognizing anomalies over time (Hnamte et al. 2023). Reinforcement
          learning has introduced a dynamic approach to intrusion detection by
          enabling systems to learn and adapt through interactions with the
          network environment. RL-based models, such as those employing
          Q-learning and DQN, have shown promise in optimizing detection
          strategies by continuously improving their performance based on
          feedback from the network’s response to various actions (Alavizadeh et
          al. 2022). These models can effectively handle the
          exploration-exploitation trade-off, crucial for identifying both known
          and novel threats. Recent research has explored ensemble learning
          techniques to combine the strengths of various ML models, thereby
          enhancing the overall detection accuracy and robustness of IDS.
          Ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting have been
          utilized to aggregate predictions from multiple models, mitigating
          individual weaknesses and reducing the likelihood of false positives
          and negatives (Thockchom et al. 2023). Key contributions in the field
          include the development of sophisticated DL architec tures that can
          process high-dimensional network traffic data, the application of RL
          for adaptive and real-time intrusion detection, and the integration of
          ensemble learning tech niques to enhance model robustness.
          Furthermore, advancements in feature extraction 7 and selection,
          leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and
          statis tical analysis, have significantly improved the
          interpretability and accuracy of IDS (Das et al. 2020). Overall, the
          confluence of DL, RL, and ensemble learning represents a significant
          leap forward in the capability to detect and mitigate network
          intrusions, providing more adaptive, accurate, and resilient IDS
          solutions. The ongoing research and development in this field continue
          to push the boundaries of what is possible in network security, paving
          the way for more secure and resilient information systems. 2.2 Current
          Discussions and Research Gaps Despite extensive research efforts in
          the field, the majority of existing studies have pri marily focused on
          ensemble approaches that combine similar types of models, such as DL
          with DL or CMLwith CML.However, a conspicuous gap exists in the
          literature regarding methodologies explicitly tailored to mitigate the
          shortcomings of standalone DL and RL approaches in intrusion
          detection. Dutta et al. (2020), Thockchom et al. (2023), and Imran et
          al. (2021) have delved into ensemble techniques that integrate various
          DL and ML models to bolster detection ac curacy. While commendable,
          these studies fall short of directly addressing the challenges
          intrinsic to standalone DL and RL methodologies. Similarly, research
          by Fitni & Ramli (2020) and Gao et al. (2019) underscores the
          significance of ensemble learning and feature selection in enhancing
          IDS performance. Nonetheless, their approaches, albeit effective,
          still rely on combinations of existing DL or ML algorithms without
          specifically targeting the limitations of standalone DL and RL models.
          In contrast, Rajadurai & Gandhi (2020) introduced a stacked ensemble
          learning model tailored for intrusion detection in wireless networks.
          While their model exhibited im proved performance compared to
          traditional methods, it predominantly focused on com bining gradient
          boosting machine and random forest algorithms, overlooking the unique
          challenges posed by standalone DL and RL approaches. 8 2.3 Importance
          for Current Investigation This study aims to address significant gaps
          in the field of network intrusion detection by evaluating and
          comparing the performance of various DL and RL models. By exploring
          both traditional and contemporary techniques, this research seeks to
          identify the most effective methods for detecting network intrusions.
          Furthermore, this study will develop an innovative ensemble learning
          technique to integrate the strengths of the best pre-trained DL and RL
          models. By leveraging a benchmark dataset, the research will aim to
          combine these models in a way that en hances overall detection
          capabilities, reduces false positives, and improves adaptability to
          evolving threats. The ensemble approach is anticipated to provide a
          more robust and reliable intrusion detection system compared to
          standalone models. This research also focuses on optimizing the
          ensemble model through fine-tuning hy perparameters, utilizing
          existing benchmark datasets and insights from the literature. By
          systematically refining these parameters, the study aims to enhance
          the precision, re call, F1 score, and reduce the false positive rate,
          ultimately leading to superior intrusion detection performance. The
          findings from this investigation will contribute to the broader field
          of network security by offering insights into the effectiveness of
          different DL and RL approaches, as well as the potential of ensemble
          learning techniques. This research underscores the importance of
          combining advanced machine learning models to develop adaptive and
          resilient intrusion detection systems. By addressing the challenges of
          current IDS, this study aims to significantly improve the detection
          and mitigation of network threats, thereby enhancing the security and
          reliability of networked systems. 9 3 Research Methodology 3.1
          Theoretical Background This study is grounded in the principles of
          ensemble learning, specifically focusing on combining pre-trained DL
          and RL models to enhance network intrusion detection. The theoretical
          framework builds upon key concepts such as model training,
          hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The integration of
          DL and RL models leverages their respective strengths—DL’s ability to
          identify patterns in data and RL’s adaptability to dynamic
          environments. This approach aims to address the limitations of using
          DL and RL models in isolation, such as high false positive rates and
          difficulties in handling large datasets due to the state explosion
          problem. The stacking method will be employed as the ensemble
          technique due to its capability to effectively combine diverse models.
          This involves training a meta-classifier on the out puts of the base
          models (DL and RL) to learn the best way to combine their predictions.
          The effectiveness of this method will be evaluated using standardized
          performance met rics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, providing a comprehensive assessment of the ensemble
          model’s capabilities. The significance of this study lies in its
          potential to advance the field of network intrusion detection by
          leveraging ensemble learning techniques to combine pre-trained DL and
          RL models. By addressing the current challenges in network intrusion
          detection, this research aims to achieve the following: 1. By
          evaluating how an ensemble model that integrates DL and RL performs in
          de tecting network intrusions, this study will provide valuable
          insights into the prac tical applicability and effectiveness of such
          models. This could lead to improved methodologies for identifying and
          mitigating network threats. 2. Through the optimization of the
          ensemble model by fine-tuning hyperparameters using existing benchmark
          datasets, this research aims to enhance the detection capabilities of
          network intrusion detection systems. This will ensure the model is
          well-calibrated to effectively identify and classify both known and
          novel threats. 3. By creating a model capable of adapting to new and
          evolving network threats, this research will contribute to the
          development of more robust and resilient net work intrusion detection
          systems that can effectively counteract sophisticated and previously
          unseen cyber-attack strategies. 4. This study will address existing
          gaps in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the
          integration of DL and RL models through ensemble learning. By doing
          so, it will advance the understanding of the most effective techniques
          for com bining these models, contributing valuable knowledge to the
          field of cybersecurity research and development. 5. Utilizing
          well-known benchmark datasets such as CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS2017,
          and UNSW-NB15, this study will establish a standardized framework for
          evaluating the performance of network intrusion detection systems.
          This will facilitate the comparison of different approaches and
          promote the adoption of best practices in the industry. 4 6.
          Thefindings from this research can be directly applied to improve the
          network intru sion detection mechanisms used by various organizations,
          including governmental, f inancial, and healthcare institutions.
          Enhancing the overall security posture of these entities will
          contribute to a safer and more secure digital environment. Bycombining
          the strengths of DL and RL, the proposed research aims to provide a
          deeper understanding of ensemble learning techniques in network
          intrusion detection, ultimately leading to more effective strategies
          for safeguarding digital infrastructures against cyber threats. 1.5

          Enhancing the overall security posture of these entities will
          contribute to a safer and more secure digital environment. Bycombining
          the strengths of DL and RL, the proposed research aims to provide a
          deeper understanding of ensemble learning techniques in network
          intrusion detection, ultimately leading to more effective strategies
          for safeguarding digital infrastructures against cyber threats. 1.5
          Scope of the Study The scope of this study encompasses the
          investigation and evaluation of ensemble learn ing techniques for
          network intrusion detection, specifically focusing on the integration
          of pre-trained DL and RL models. This research will utilize publicly
          available benchmark datasets, including CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS2017,
          and UNSW-NB15, to ensure trans parency and reproducibility of results.
          The study will identify the best-performing DL and RL models for
          network intrusion detection from the last three years based on their
          F1 score and reproducibility. The research will develop an ensemble
          learning model that integrates the selected pre-trained DL and RL
          models, using the stacking method to combine their outputs. The
          performance of this ensemble model will be evaluated using
          standardized metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, and compared against stan dalone DL and RL models.
          Cross-validation and ROC curves will be employed to provide
          comprehensive insights into model performance across different
          decision thresholds. Additionally, the study will involve fine-tuning
          the hyperparameters of the ensemble model using existing benchmark
          datasets to enhance detection capabilities. Random search will be
          utilized to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and optimize
          the model. Proportional stratified sampling will be employed as the
          sampling technique to ensure that the dataset is representative of
          various classes of network traffic, providing a robust foundation for
          training and evaluation. However, the study is limited by the datasets
          used, which may not capture the full diversity of network traffic and
          attack scenarios encountered in real-world environments. Computational
          resource constraints and time limitations may impact the extent of
          model 5 training and evaluation. The research will focus on specific
          DL and RL models identified through the literature review,
          acknowledging that other models not included in this study may also be
          effective for network intrusion detection. The ultimate goal of this
          study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness
          of ensemble learning techniques in network intrusion detection,
          contributing to the development of more robust and adaptable network
          security systems. 6 2 Literature Review 2.1 Main Discoveries in the
          Field The field of network intrusion detection has evolved
          considerably over the past few years, driven by advancements in DL and
          RL methodologies. Early IDS relied heavily on signature-based and
          anomaly-based techniques, which, while effective in specific scenar
          ios, often struggled with adaptability and scalability in the face of
          evolving cyber threats (Denning 1987). Deep learning models,
          particularly those utilizing architectures such as CNNs and RNNs, have
          demonstrated substantial improvements in intrusion detection
          capabilities. CNNs, traditionally used in image processing, have been
          effectively adapted to identify patterns in network traffic data,
          capturing spatial hierarchies and achieving high detection rates (Wang
          et al. 2017). RNNs, and their variants like LSTM networks, have been
          employed to model temporal dependencies in sequential data, proving
          particularly useful in detecting multi-step attack sequences and
          recognizing anomalies over time (Hnamte et al. 2023). Reinforcement
          learning has introduced a dynamic approach to intrusion detection by
          enabling systems to learn and adapt through interactions with the
          network environment. RL-based models, such as those employing
          Q-learning and DQN, have shown promise in optimizing detection
          strategies by continuously improving their performance based on
          feedback from the network’s response to various actions (Alavizadeh et
          al. 2022). These models can effectively handle the
          exploration-exploitation trade-off, crucial for identifying both known
          and novel threats. Recent research has explored ensemble learning
          techniques to combine the strengths of various ML models, thereby
          enhancing the overall detection accuracy and robustness of IDS.
          Ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting have been
          utilized to aggregate predictions from multiple models, mitigating
          individual weaknesses and reducing the likelihood of false positives
          and negatives (Thockchom et al. 2023). Key contributions in the field
          include the development of sophisticated DL architec tures that can
          process high-dimensional network traffic data, the application of RL
          for adaptive and real-time intrusion detection, and the integration of
          ensemble learning tech niques to enhance model robustness.
          Furthermore, advancements in feature extraction 7 and selection,
          leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and
          statis tical analysis, have significantly improved the
          interpretability and accuracy of IDS (Das et al. 2020). Overall, the
          confluence of DL, RL, and ensemble learning represents a significant
          leap forward in the capability to detect and mitigate network
          intrusions, providing more adaptive, accurate, and resilient IDS
          solutions. The ongoing research and development in this field continue
          to push the boundaries of what is possible in network security, paving
          the way for more secure and resilient information systems. 2.2 Current
          Discussions and Research Gaps Despite extensive research efforts in
          the field, the majority of existing studies have pri marily focused on
          ensemble approaches that combine similar types of models, such as DL
          with DL or CMLwith CML.However, a conspicuous gap exists in the
          literature regarding methodologies explicitly tailored to mitigate the
          shortcomings of standalone DL and RL approaches in intrusion
          detection. Dutta et al. (2020), Thockchom et al. (2023), and Imran et
          al. (2021) have delved into ensemble techniques that integrate various
          DL and ML models to bolster detection ac curacy. While commendable,
          these studies fall short of directly addressing the challenges
          intrinsic to standalone DL and RL methodologies. Similarly, research
          by Fitni & Ramli (2020) and Gao et al. (2019) underscores the
          significance of ensemble learning and feature selection in enhancing
          IDS performance. Nonetheless, their approaches, albeit effective,
          still rely on combinations of existing DL or ML algorithms without
          specifically targeting the limitations of standalone DL and RL models.
          In contrast, Rajadurai & Gandhi (2020) introduced a stacked ensemble
          learning model tailored for intrusion detection in wireless networks.
          While their model exhibited im proved performance compared to
          traditional methods, it predominantly focused on com bining gradient
          boosting machine and random forest algorithms, overlooking the unique
          challenges posed by standalone DL and RL approaches. 8 2.3 Importance
          for Current Investigation This study aims to address significant gaps
          in the field of network intrusion detection by evaluating and
          comparing the performance of various DL and RL models. By exploring
          both traditional and contemporary techniques, this research seeks to
          identify the most effective methods for detecting network intrusions.
          Furthermore, this study will develop an innovative ensemble learning
          technique to integrate the strengths of the best pre-trained DL and RL
          models. By leveraging a benchmark dataset, the research will aim to
          combine these models in a way that en hances overall detection
          capabilities, reduces false positives, and improves adaptability to
          evolving threats. The ensemble approach is anticipated to provide a
          more robust and reliable intrusion detection system compared to
          standalone models. This research also focuses on optimizing the
          ensemble model through fine-tuning hy perparameters, utilizing
          existing benchmark datasets and insights from the literature. By
          systematically refining these parameters, the study aims to enhance
          the precision, re call, F1 score, and reduce the false positive rate,
          ultimately leading to superior intrusion detection performance. The
          findings from this investigation will contribute to the broader field
          of network security by offering insights into the effectiveness of
          different DL and RL approaches, as well as the potential of ensemble
          learning techniques. This research underscores the importance of
          combining advanced machine learning models to develop adaptive and
          resilient intrusion detection systems. By addressing the challenges of
          current IDS, this study aims to significantly improve the detection
          and mitigation of network threats, thereby enhancing the security and
          reliability of networked systems. 9 3 Research Methodology 3.1
          Theoretical Background This study is grounded in the principles of
          ensemble learning, specifically focusing on combining pre-trained DL
          and RL models to enhance network intrusion detection. The theoretical
          framework builds upon key concepts such as model training,
          hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The integration of
          DL and RL models leverages their respective strengths—DL’s ability to
          identify patterns in data and RL’s adaptability to dynamic
          environments. This approach aims to address the limitations of using
          DL and RL models in isolation, such as high false positive rates and
          difficulties in handling large datasets due to the state explosion
          problem. The stacking method will be employed as the ensemble
          technique due to its capability to effectively combine diverse models.
          This involves training a meta-classifier on the out puts of the base
          models (DL and RL) to learn the best way to combine their predictions.
          The effectiveness of this method will be evaluated using standardized
          performance met rics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false
          positive rate, providing a comprehensive assessment of the ensemble
          model’s capabilities. The significance of this study lies in its
          potential to advance the field of network intrusion detection by
          leveraging ensemble learning techniques to combine pre-trained DL and
          RL models. By addressing the current challenges in network intrusion
          detection, this research aims to achieve the following: 1. By
          evaluating how an ensemble model that integrates DL and RL performs in
          de tecting network intrusions, this study will provide valuable
          insights into the prac tical applicability and effectiveness of such
          models. This could lead to improved methodologies for identifying and
          mitigating network threats. 2. Through the optimization of the
          ensemble model by fine-tuning hyperparameters using existing benchmark
          datasets, this research aims to enhance the detection capabilities of
          network intrusion detection systems. This will ensure the model is
          well-calibrated to effectively identify and classify both known and
          novel threats. 3. By creating a model capable of adapting to new and
          evolving network threats, this research will contribute to the
          development of more robust and resilient net work intrusion detection
          systems that can effectively counteract sophisticated and previously
          unseen cyber-attack strategies. 4. This study will address existing
          gaps in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the
          integration of DL and RL models through ensemble learning. By doing
          so, it will advance the understanding of the most effective techniques
          for com bining these models, contributing valuable knowledge to the
          field of cybersecurity research and development. 5. Utilizing
          well-known benchmark datasets such as CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS2017,
          and UNSW-NB15, this study will establish a standardized framework for
          evaluating the performance of network intrusion detection systems.
          This will facilitate the comparison of different approaches and
          promote the adoption of best practices in the industry. 4 6.
